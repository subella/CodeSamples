# Fast Collision Detection
This project involves fast collision detection of line segments for a screensaver application. Our solution uses a quadtree structure with parallelization.

## Details for reviewer

* This work was done with a partner in a pair-programming fashion.

* `project_2_collision_detection.pdf` is the problem prompt for more context.

* `write_up.pdf` explains our approach.

* `quadtree.c` and `quadtree.h` are where our solution is.
