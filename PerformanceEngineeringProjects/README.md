# Course Description
6.172 is an 18-unit class that provides a hands-on, project-based introduction to building scalable and high-performance software systems. Topics include performance analysis, algorithmic techniques for high performance, instruction-level optimizations, caching optimizations, parallel programming, and building scalable systems. The course programming language is C

## Details for reviewer
I added 3 projects we did in the course. Project 1 uses bit hacks for fast bit array rotation, project 2 uses a quadtree and parallelization for fast collision detection,
project 3 implements a custom memory allocator.
